I have 2 years of diving into Kotlin and one and a half years with Android native app development. Besides, I also have experience in web development with Rails and React.js.
I always focus on the quality and extensibility of the code.
I'm going deeply to mobile development and multiplatform with Kotlin.
Moreover, I usually share posts about tech.
